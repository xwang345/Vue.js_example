            Now we provide each todo-item with the todo object
            it's representing, so that its content can be dynamic.
            We also need to provide each component with a "key",
            which will be explained later.

        //This is just a contrived example, but we have managed to separate our app into two smaller units,
        // and the child is reasonably well-decoupled from the parent via the props interface.
        // We can now further improve our <todo-item> component with more complex template and logic without affecting the parent app.
